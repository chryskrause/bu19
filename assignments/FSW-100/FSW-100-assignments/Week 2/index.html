            <ol>
                <li>Donate to reputable agencies (listed below)</li>
                <!--block-->
                <li>Search for and buy products that protect against deforestation. (They will be labeled FSC or RA certified products)</li>
                <!--block-->
                <li>Sign petitions.</li>
                <li>Reduce paper, wood, and beef consumption. Our use of paper and wood could be reduced, and farmers clear areas of rainforest to make room for rising beef/cattle demands.</li>
